# Directory Tree

A small play project that, given a directory, prints an indented tree of that directory's files and subdirectories.

# Motivation

Simply to practice some python.

# Example

The output will look something like the following:

```
Main Folder
    image_1.JPG (850 kB)
    image_2.JPG (898 kB)
    image_3.JPG (579 kB)
    Subfolder_1
        another_image.png (1.38 MB)
        text_file.txt (0 kB)
        Deeper Subfolder
            image_4.JPG (722 kB)
    Subfolder_2
        another_text_file.txt (0 kB)
```
